# Multiparty with JS SDK

This is a sample app that demonstrates how to use the Vonage Video API for users that want to provide their own video elements rather than relying on the video elements generated by the client side SDK.

This approach requires that you [disable the default UI](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/customize-ui/js/#video-element) on the publisher and subscriber side and listen to the `videoElementCreated`. Upon receiving these events, you can then feed your own video element with the `mediaStream` coming from the video element dispatched on the `videoElementCreated` event.

Note: On the subscriber side, a [further consideration[https://api.support.vonage.com/hc/en-us/articles/10901330247964-How-to-update-subscriber-stream-when-manipulating-video-element] needs to be taken into account as the mediaStream can change as part of [Adaptive Media Routing](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/create-session/). This application already handles that scenario. See the `CustomSubscriber` component.

## Running the app

1. Install dependencies `npm install`
2. Replace credentials in `Context/session.jsx`
3. Run `npm run dev:frontend`
4. Visit `http://localhost:5173/`
